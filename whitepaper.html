            <li><strong>Immersive Gameplay:</strong> Offer a rich city-building experience where players mine resources, construct buildings, and compete or cooperate in a dynamic Wild West setting.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Empowerment:</strong> Enable players to earn real-world value through NFTs and tokens, with full ownership and transferability of in-game assets.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Governance:</strong> Foster a player-driven ecosystem where governance decisions are made through decentralized mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Ensure compatibility with other Web3 platforms and marketplaces for seamless asset trading and cross-platform interactions.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">3. Core Mechanics</h2>

        <p>Aint City blends social networking and city-building gameplay, creating a unique experience that rewards creativity, strategy, and collaboration. Below are the core mechanics of the platform.</p>

        <h3>3.1. Digital Resource Mining</h3>

        <p>Players begin by staking a claim on virtual land, represented as NFTs. Land parcels vary in size, resource availability, and strategic value. Players mine digital resources such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gold (GLD):</strong> A primary currency used for transactions and upgrades.</li>
            <li><strong>Ore (ORE):</strong> A resource for constructing buildings and tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Crypto Shards (CRS):</strong> A premium resource tied to in-game crypto mines, convertible to platform tokens.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Mining requires computational effort (simulated or blockchain-based) and consumes in-game energy, which players can replenish through strategic decisions or token purchases.</p>

        <h3>3.2. City Building</h3>

        <p>Using mined resources, players construct buildings such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Saloons:</strong> Social hubs for player interactions, hosting chats, events, and mini-games.</li>
            <li><strong>Ranches:</strong> Production centers for generating resources like food and livestock.</li>
            <li><strong>Crypto Mines:</strong> Specialized structures that yield CRS, enhancing economic output.</li>
            <li><strong>Sheriff Stations:</strong> Defensive structures that protect against rival attacks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Buildings are represented as NFTs, fully owned by players and tradable on external marketplaces. Upgrades improve functionality, aesthetics, and economic output.</p>

        <h3>3.3. Social Networking</h3>

        <p>Aint City's social layer is powered by decentralized chat systems, ensuring privacy and security. Key features include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decentralized Chats:</strong> Peer-to-peer messaging encrypted via blockchain protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Alliances:</strong> Players form guilds to pool resources, share strategies, and defend against rivals.</li>
            <li><strong>Rival Showdowns:</strong> Competitive events where players or alliances battle for resources, land, or prestige.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Social interactions are gamified, with rewards for hosting events, recruiting allies, or winning showdowns.</p>

        <h3>3.4. Competitive and Cooperative Gameplay</h3>

        <p>Players can choose to collaborate or compete:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cooperative Play:</strong> Form alliances to build shared settlements, trade resources, or defend against external threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Competitive Play:</strong> Engage in showdowns, raids, or economic sabotage to dominate the frontier.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Showdowns are resolved through strategic battles, leveraging building defenses, player skills, and alliance support. Winners earn resources, NFTs, or territorial control.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">4. Blockchain Integration</h2>
